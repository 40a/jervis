<a id="about-jervis" class="anchor" href="#about-jervis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Jervis</h1>

<ul>
<li>What is Jervis?  A library for <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin">Job DSL plugin</a>
scripts.</li>
<li>What is Jervis not?  Jervis is not a plugin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jervis uses Travis-like job generation using the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin">Job DSL
plugin</a> and groovy scripts.  It reads the <code>.jervis.yml</code>
file of a project and generates a job in Jenkins based on it.  If <code>.jervis.yml</code>
doesn't exist then it will fall back to using the <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/"><code>.travis.yml</code></a>
file.</p>

<p>For development planning and other documentation see the <a href="https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/wiki">Jervis
wiki</a>.  If you wish to stay up to date with the latest Jervis news
then please feel free to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/">watch this repository</a> because I use the

<h2>
<a id="why-jervis" class="anchor" href="#why-jervis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Jervis?</h2>

<p>What is Jervis attempting to scale?  Let's talk about some scale bottlenecks
that have been overcome by Jenkins (formerly Hudson) and its community.</p>

<p>The scaling issue is a main bullet. The solution for the issue is in a
sub-bullet.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developers are challenged with building often and even deploying often.

<ul>
<li>Jenkins was invented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jenkins infrastructure is strained when too many slaves are in one master and
too many jobs are queued up on a daily basis.  A single master struggles to
perform all requested builds in a timely manner.  Jenkins also suffers from
single point of failure as a lone master.

<ul>
<li>Multi-master Jenkins was invented. This provides redundancy for the master.
Throughput for daily build capacity is improved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jenkins jobs suffer from a lot of duplicate code.  It is difficult to fix a
bug in one job and have it propagate to other jobs.

<ul>
<li>Jenkins Job DSL plugin was invented.  Configuration through code is now
possible.  Multiple jobs can be generated and regenerated with the same code
using templates in a domain specific language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Onboarding new projects in a Jenkins installation can be difficult.  Typically
engineers will get together and discuss the needs of the project and then
configure a Jenkins job for the needs of the project.  For enterprises with a
very large number of projects it is typically hard to scale number of build
engineers to match with the large number of projects which require onboarding
into the build ecosystem.

<ul>
<li>Jervis is being invented.  Job generation through convention over
configuration.  Scaling the onboarding for a project by creating and abiding
by conventions in how jobs are generated.  This is for large scale job
generation and project onboarding.  Jervis is taking lessons learned from a
seasoned build engineer and attempting to fill this gap in the Jenkins
ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
