Jervis is not a plugin.\r\n\r\nJervis uses Travis-like job generation using the [Job DSL\r\nplugin][jenkins-plugin-job-dsl] and groovy scripts.  It reads the `.jervis.yml`\r\nfile of a project and generates a job in Jenkins based on it.  If `.jervis.yml`\r\ndoesn't exist then it will fall back to using the [`.travis.yml`][travis-yaml]\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nFor development planning and other documentation see the [Jervis\r\nwiki][jervis-wiki].  If you wish to stay up to date with the latest Jervis news\r\nthen please feel free to [watch this repository][watch-repo] because I use the\r\nissue tracking and wiki for planning.\r\n\r\n## Why Jervis?\r\n\r\nWhat is Jervis attempting to scale?  Let's talk about some scale bottlenecks\r\nthat have been overcome by Jenkins (formerly Hudson) and its community.\r\n\r\nThe scaling issue is a main bullet. The solution for the issue is in a\r\nsub-bullet.\r\n\r\n* Developers are challenged with building often and even deploying often.\r\n  * Jenkins was invented.\r\n* Jenkins infrastructure is strained when too many slaves are in one master and\r\n  too many jobs are queued up on a daily basis.  A single master struggles to\r\n  perform all requested builds in a timely manner.  Jenkins also suffers from\r\n  single point of failure as a lone master.\r\n  * Multi-master Jenkins was invented. This provides redundancy for the master.\r\n    Throughput for daily build capacity is improved.\r\n* Jenkins jobs suffer from a lot of duplicate code.  It is difficult to fix a\r\n  bug in one job and have it propagate to other jobs.\r\n  * Jenkins Job DSL plugin was invented.  Configuration through code is now\r\n    possible.  Multiple jobs can be generated and regenerated with the same code\r\n    using templates in a domain specific language.\r\n* Onboarding new projects in a Jenkins installation can be difficult.  Typically\r\n  engineers will get together and discuss the needs of the project and then\r\n  configure a Jenkins job for the needs of the project.  For enterprises with a\r\n  very large number of projects it is typically hard to scale number of build\r\n  engineers to match with the large number of projects which require onboarding\r\n  into the build ecosystem.\r\n  * Jervis is being invented.  Job generation through convention over\r\n    configuration.  Scaling the onboarding for a project by creating and abiding\r\n    by conventions in how jobs are generated.  This is for large scale job\r\n    generation and project onboarding.  Jervis is taking lessons learned from a\r\n    seasoned build engineer and attempting to fill this gap in the Jenkins\r\n    ecosystem.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n* Quickstart: [jenkins-bootstrap-jervis][jbj]\r\n* [Jervis Wiki][jervis-wiki]\r\n  * [Build Overview][jervis-wiki-overview]\r\n  * [Supported Languages][jervis-wiki-langs]\r\n  * [Supported Build Tools][jervis-wiki-tools]\r\n\r\nRefer to the [Jervis Wiki][jervis-wiki] for a quickstart guide and rolling\r\nJervis out for production.  There's also the [jenkins-bootstrap-jervis][jbj]\r\nproject to get up and running quickly.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2014-2015 Sam Gleske\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n[jbj]: https://github.com/samrocketman/jenkins-bootstrap-jervis\r\n[jenkins]: https://jenkins-ci.org/\r\n[jenkins-plugin-job-dsl]: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin\r\n[jervis-coveralls]: https://coveralls.io/r/samrocketman/jervis?branch=master\r\n[jervis-travis]: https://travis-ci.org/samrocketman/jervis\r\n[jervis-versioneye]: https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/54f2a1cc4f3108959a0007f1\r\n[jervis-wiki]: https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/wiki\r\n[jervis-wiki-overview]: https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/wiki/Build-overview\r\n[jervis-wiki-langs]: https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/wiki/Supported-Languages\r\n[jervis-wiki-tools]: https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/wiki/Supported-Tools\r\n[milestone-progress]: https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/milestones\r\n[status-build]: https://travis-ci.org/samrocketman/jervis.svg?branch=master\r\n[status-coverage]: https://coveralls.io/repos/samrocketman/jervis/badge.svg?branch=master\r\n[status-versioneye]: https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/54f2a1cc4f3108959a0007f1/badge.svg?style=flat\r\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/\r\n[travis-yaml]: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/\r\n[watch-repo]: https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/\r\n[wiki-ci]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration\r\n[wiki-os]: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
