In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions
from any person or entity, Sam Gleske or any entity he represents (herein "the
Developer") must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has
been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms
below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the
protection of the Developer and its users; it does not change your rights to use
your own Contributions for any other purpose.
